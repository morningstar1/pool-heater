/**
Functions for simplified LCD usage. This module is for HD44780 and compatible
display controllers. Note that this controller has a display
memory for two lines with 64 characters on each, but most displays
only show a part of them. The displayed are can be scrolled in such a
case.

Usual way to start-up the display:
    lcdOn();
    lcdInit();
 optional: lcdDownloadFont(font, size);
 optional: configure cursor, set cursor position:<UL>
        lcdInstr(LCDLINE1 + x)
        lcdInstr(LCDLINE2 + x)

very useful ;-) write some text using:
    lcdPuts("text");
    lcdPutc('c');

Some instruction need special care, see lcdInstr() for details.

/**
Write an instruction to the LCD.

There is a short delay after the instruction. This is because the display
controller needs some time execute it. The databook says that 40us are needed
(exceptions, see below). This function makes a delay of approx. 70us @ MCLK=1.5MHz.

Some instructions are defined in the header file. See there for details.

IMPORTANT:
Some instructions use much more time execution time on the display controller.
If such an instruction is used, the user of this function MUST call
lcdDelay(LCDDELAY2) after calling this function!

The instructions where this is needed are:
    LCDON
    LCDCLEAR

/**
Write a single character in CGRAM or DDRAM of display controller.

When the memory pointer is set to DDRAM (which is the same as the
cursor position), the character is written to the display. The lower 127
charcters are the well-known ASCII symbols. The charachters 0 to 7 are
the user defined characters. The upper 127 characters contain some symbols
and mostly japanese characters. Look at a display manual for a complete
table of usable characters.

See lcdInstr() on how to set the cursor position.

If the memory pointer is set to CGRAM, user defined bitmaps can
be downloaded. Please note that this is better done by
lcdDownloadFont().

/**
Write font data in CGRAM. This function is intended to download the
user definable characters to the display. These are 8 bytes per
characte and our display has eight free programmable characters. This
makes a maximum of 64 bytes (the function has a limit of ~32000 bytes,
but the display controller is limited).

This function always starts with downloading the user charcter 0. If you
want to replace some characters during program the following procedure
is recomended:
    - Download all eight characters. The ones that never change
      are located at the end of this font definition.
    - To replace some charactters, e.g. two. you use this
      function to download 16 bytes from an other font,
      which overwrite the first two character bitmaps.
    - Switching back to the original charachters is done
      by downloading 16 bytes (or all 64 bytes) from the
      same pointer as in point 1.

Charcter data is specified in the following way:
//Font
const unsigned char lcdfont[] = {
    //Charchter 0
  0x0a,   //00001010
  0x15,   //00010101
  0x0a,   //00001010
  0x15,   //00010101
  0x0a,   //00001010
  0x15,   //00010101
  0x0a,   //00001010
  0x15,   //00010101
    //Charchter 1
  0x00,   //00000000
        . . .
        . . .
    //Charchter 7
  0x00,   //00000000
  0x1f,   //00011111
  0x1f,   //00011111
  0x1f,   //00011111
  0x1f,   //00011111
  0x1f,   //00011111
  0x1f,   //00011111
  0x1f,   //00011111
};

As you see only 5x8 pixels are used by the display controller. The
5 pixels in the with are located toward the LSB.
